/ NB: you !!!must!!!! read and possibly edit configure.h before building this project.
/
/ Latter parts of this (c) Cliff Lawson, 2013. This uses asmfunc.S, and mmc.c
/ from ChaN's original code but otherwise it's a rewrite of the FAT aware
/ sections to do a very specific job of finding just one file and keeping the
/ code footprint to about 1K..2K suitable for small mega AVRs. The same license
/ applies for newly added code.

/ Dec 6, 2010  R0.01  First release
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/ This is a stand-alone MMC/SD boot loader for megaAVRs. It requires a 4KB
/ boot section for code, four GPIO pins for MMC/SD as shown in sch.jpg and
/ nothing else. To port the boot loader into your project, follow the
/ instruction sdescribed below.
/
/ 1. Setup the hardware. Attach a memory card socket to the any GPIO port
/    where you like. Select boot size at least 4KB for the boot loader with
/    BOOTSZ fuses and enable boot loader with BOOTRST fuse.
/
/ 2. Setup the software. Change the four port definitions in the asmfunc.S.
/    Change MCU_TARGET, BOOT_ADR and MCU_FREQ in the Makefile. The BOOT_ADR
/    is a BYTE address of boot section in the flash. Build the boot loader
/    and write it to the device with a programmer.
/
/ 3. Build the application program and output it in binary form instead of
/    hex format. Rename the file "app.bin" and put it into the memory card.
/
/ 4. Insert the card and turn the target power on. When the boot loader found
/    the application file, the file is written into the flash memory prior to
/    start the application program. On-board LED lights (if exist) during
/    the flash programming operation.
